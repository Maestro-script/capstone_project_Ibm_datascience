Data

Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decission are:

number of existing gas stations around the location.
number of and distance to gas stations in the neighborhood, if any.
distance of neighborhood from central business district.
We decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.

Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:

centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using Google Maps API reverse geocoding
number of gas stations and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API
coordinate of Jakarta center will be obtained using Google Maps API geocoding of well known Jakarta location (Monumen Nasional)
