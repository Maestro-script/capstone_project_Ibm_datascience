Introduction: Business Problems


In this project we will try to find the best location for a gas station. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a gas station in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Since there are some gas stations in Jakarta, we will try to detect locations that are relatively crowded with vehicles. We are also particularly interested in areas with no gas stations around. We would also prefer locations nearby central business district as near as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met.

We will use our data science capacity to produce a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Benefits of each area will then be clearly stated so that best possible final location can be considered and chosen by stakeholders.
